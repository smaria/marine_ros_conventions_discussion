Header header            # timestamp in the header is the acquisition time of

                         # with zero angle being forward along the x axis

float32 angle_min        # start angle of the image [rad]
float32 angle_max        # end angle of the image [rad], empty for single beam
float32 angle_increment  # angular distance between beam centers [rad], empty for single beam

float32 beam_width_z     # opening angle, rotation around z axis [rad]

# arrays with sonar measurements 
# first entry corresponds to measurement in angle_min direction,
# consecutive entries from directions with angle_increment added to the previous direction
# there are (angle_max - angle_min) / angle_increment + 1 measurements in each field
# if only ranges or arrays with intensities are available, leave the other empty
